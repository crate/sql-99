Chapter 11 -- Row types
=======================

[Obscure Rule] applies for this entire chapter.

In SQL, a <row type> is a row of data: a composite constructed SQL <data type>.
A row in a Table is an instance of a <row type> and every row of the same Table
has the same type -- the intent is to provide a <data type> that can represent
the rows of a Table, so that complete rows can be stored in variables, passed
as arguments to routines and returned by functions.

Row <data type>s
================

A <row type> is defined by a descriptor that contains three pieces of
information:

1. The <data type>'s name: ``ROW``.

2. The <data type>'s degree: the number of Fields that belong to the row.

3. A descriptor for every Field that belongs to the row. The Field descriptor
   contains the name of the Field, the Field's ordinal position in the <row
   type>, the Field's <data type> and nullability attribute (or, if the Field
   is based on a Domain, the name of that Domain), the Field's Character set
   and default Collation (for character string <data type>s) and the Field's
   <reference scope check> (for <reference type>s).

*ROW*
-----

The required syntax for a <row type> specification is as follows.

::

    <row type> ::=
    ROW (<Field definition> [ {,<Field definition>}... ])

       <Field definition> ::=
       <Field name> {<data type> | <Domain name>}
          [ <reference scope check> ]
          [ COLLATE <Collation name> ]

A <row type> specification defines a row of data: it consists of a sequence of
one or more parenthesized {<Field name>,<data type>} pairs, known as Fields.
The degree of a row is the number of Fields it contains. A value of a row
consists of one value for each of its Fields, while a value of a Field is a
value of the Field's <data type>. Each Field in a row must have a unique name.
Here is an example of a <row type> specification:

::

   ROW (field_1 INT, field_2 DATE, field_3 INTERVAL(4) YEAR)

A <Field name> identifies a Field and is either a <regular identifier> or a
<delimited identifier> that is unique (for all Fields and Columns) within the
Table it belongs to. You can define a Field's <data type> either by putting a
<data type> specification after <Field name> or by putting a <Domain name>
after the <Field name>. The <data type> of a Field can be any type other than a
<reference type> -- in particular, it can itself be a <row type>. Here is an
example, of a <row type> specification; it defines a row with one Field (called
``field_1``) whose defined <data type> is ``DATE``:

::

   ROW (field_1 DATE)

[Obscure Rule] If the <data type> of a Field is ``CHAR``, ``VARCHAR`` or
``CLOB``, the Character set that the Field's values must belong to is
determined as follows:

- If the <Field definition> contains a <data type> specification that includes
  a ``CHARACTER SET`` clause, the Field's Character set is the Character set
  named. Your current <AuthorizationID> must have the ``USAGE`` Privilege on
  that Character set.

- If the <Field definition> does not include a <data type> specification, but
  the Field is based on a Domain whose definition includes a ``CHARACTER SET``
  clause, the Field's Character set is the Character set named.

- If the <Field definition> does not include any ``CHARACTER SET`` clause at
  all -- either through a <data type> specification or through a Domain
  definition -- the Field's Character set is the Character set named in the
  ``DEFAULT CHARACTER SET`` clause of the ``CREATE SCHEMA`` statement that
  defines the Schema that the Field belongs to.

For example, the effect of these two SQL statements:

::

   CREATE SCHEMA bob AUTHORIZATION bob
    DEFAULT CHARACTER SET INFORMATION_SCHEMA.LATIN1;
     CREATE TABLE Table_1 (
       column_1 ROW(
          field_1 CHAR(10),
          field_2 INT));

is to create a Table in Schema ``bob``. The Table has a Column with a ``ROW``
<data type>, containing two Fields. The character string Field's set of valid
values are fixed length character strings, exactly 10 characters long, all of
whose characters must be found in the ``INFORMATION_SCHEMA.LATIN1`` Character
set -- the Schema's default Character set. The effect of these two SQL
statements:

::

   CREATE SCHEMA bob AUTHORIZATION bob
    DEFAULT CHARACTER SET INFORMATION_SCHEMA.LATIN1;
     CREATE TABLE Table_1 (
       column_1 ROW(
          field_1 CHAR(10) CHARACTER SET INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SQL_CHARACTER,
          field_2 INT));

is to create the same Table with one difference: this time, the character
string Field's values must consist only of characters found in the
``INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SQL_CHARACTER`` Character set -- the explicit Character
set specification in ``CREATE TABLE`` constrains the Field's set of values. The
Schema's default Character set does not.

[Obscure Rule] If the <data type> of a Field is ``CHAR``, ``VARCHAR``,
``CLOB``, ``NCHAR``, ``NCHAR VARYING`` or ``NCLOB``, and your <Field
definition> does not include a ``COLLATE`` clause, the Field has a coercibility
attribute of ``COERCIBLE`` -- but if your <Field definition> includes a
``COLLATE`` clause, the Field has a coercibility attribute of ``IMPLICIT``. In
either case, the Field's default Collation is determined as follows:

- If the <Field definition> includes a ``COLLATE`` clause, the Field's default
  Collation is the Collation named. Your current <AuthorizationID> must have
  the ``USAGE`` Privilege on that Collation.

- If the <Field definition> does not include a ``COLLATE`` clause, but does
  contain a <data type> specification that includes a ``COLLATE`` clause, the
  Field's default Collation is the Collation named. Your current
  <AuthorizationID> must have the ``USAGE`` Privilege on that Collation.

- If the <Field definition> does not include a ``COLLATE`` clause, but the
  Field is based on a Domain whose definition includes a ``COLLATE`` clause,
  the Field's default Collation is the Collation named.

- If the <Field definition> does not include any ``COLLATE`` clause at all --
  either explicitly, through a <data type> specification or through a Domain
  definition -- the Field's default Collation is the default Collation of the
  Field's Character set.

[Obscure Rule] If the <data type> of a Field is REF(UDT), your current
<AuthorizationID> must have the ``USAGE`` Privilege on that UDT. If the <data
type> of a Field includes ``REF`` with a <scope clause>, your <Field
definition> must also include this <reference scope check> clause: ``REFERENCES
ARE [NOT] CHECKED ON DELETE NO ACTION`` -- to indicate whether references are
to be checked or not. Do not  add a <reference scope check> clause under any
other circumstances.


- If a Field is defined with ``REFERENCES ARE CHECKED``, and a <scope clause>
  is included in the <Field definition>, then there is an implied ``DEFERRABLE
  INITIALLY IMMEDIATE`` Constraint on the Field. This Constraint checks that
  the Field´s values are also found in the corresponding Field of the
  system-generated Column of the Table named in the <scope clause>.

- If the <data type> of a Field in a row is a ``UDT``, then the current
  <AuthorizationID> must have the ``USAGE`` Privilege on that ``UDT``.

- A <row type> is a subtype of a <data type> if (*a*) both are <row type>s with
  the same degree and (*b*) for every pair of corresponding <Field
  definition>s, the <Field name>s are the same and the <data type> of the Field
  in the first <row type> is a supertype of the <data type> of the Field in the
  second <row type>.

*<row reference>*
.................

A <row reference> returns a row. The required syntax for a <row reference> is
as follows.

::

    <row reference> ::=
    ROW {<Table name> | <query name> | <Correlation name>}

A row of data values belonging to a Table (or a query result, which is also a
Table) is also considered to be a <row type>. In a Table, each Column of a data
row corresponds to a Field of the <row type>: the Column and Field have the
same ordinal positions in the Table and <row type>, respectively. A <row
reference> allows you to access a specific row of a Table or a query result.
Here is an example of a <row reference> that would return a row of a Table
named ``TABLE_1``:

::

   ROW(Table_1)

*<Field reference>*
...................

A <Field reference> returns a Field of a row. The required syntax for a <Field
reference> is as follows.

::

    <Field reference> ::=
    row_argument.<Field name>

A <Field reference> allows you to access a specific Field of a row. It
operates on two arguments: the first must evaluate to a <row type> and the
second must be the name of a Field belonging to that row. If the value of
``row_argument`` is ``NULL``, then the specified Field is also ``NULL``. If
``row_argument`` has a non-null value, the value of the Field reference is the
value of the specified Field in ``row_argument``. Here is an example of a <Field
reference> that would return the value of a Field named ``FIELD_1`` that belongs
to a row of ``TABLE_1``:

::

   ROW(Table_1).field_1

*<row value constructor>*
.........................

An <row value constructor> is used to construct a row of data. The required
syntax for a <row value constructor> is as follows.

::

    <row value constructor> ::=
    element_expression |
    [ ROW ] (element_expression [ {,element_expression}... ]) |
    ( <query expression> )

       element_expression ::=
       element_expression |
       NULL |
       ARRAY[] |
       ARRAY??(??) |
       DEFAULT

A <row value constructor> allows you to assign values to the Fields of a row,
using either a list of ``element_expressions`` of the result of a subquery. An
``element_expression`` may be any expression that evaluates to a scalar value
with a <data type> that is assignable to the corresponding Field's <data type>.
A subquery -- ( <query expression> ) -- is discussed in our chapter on complex
queries. The result is a row whose *n*-th Field value is the value of the
*n*-th ``element_expression`` (or whose value is the value of the subquery) you
specify. If your ``element_expression`` is ``NULL``, the corresponding Field is
assigned the null value. If your ``element_expression`` is ``ARRAY[]`` or
``ARRAY??(??)``, the corresponding Field is assigned an empty array. If your
``element_expression`` is ``DEFAULT``, the corresponding Field is assigned its
default value. Here is an example of a <row value constructor>:

::

   ROW ('hello',567,DATE '1994-07-15',NULL,DEFAULT,ARRAY[])

This example constructs a row with six Fields. The first Field has a character
string value of ``'hello'``, the second has a numeric value of ``567``, the
third has a date value of ``'1994-07-15'``, the fourth has a null value, the
fifth has a value that is the fifth Field's default value and the sixth has a
value that is an empty array. This <row value constructor> would be valid for
this <row type> specification:

::

   ROW (
     field_1 CHAR(5),
     field_2 SMALLINT,
     field_3 DATE,
     field_4 BIT(4),
     field_5 domain_1,
     field_6 INT ARRAY[4])

A <row value constructor> serves the same purpose for a row as a <literal> does
for a predefined <data type>. It has the same format as the <row type>'s ``ROW
()`` -- but instead of a series of <Field definition>s inside the size
delimiters, it contains comma-delimited values of the correct <data type> for
each Field. For example, if your <row type> specification is:

::

   ROW (field_1 INT, field_2 CHAR(5), field_3 BIT(4))

a valid <row value constructor> would be:

::

   ROW(20,'hello',B'1011')

If you construct a row with a subquery, the row takes on the <data type> of
the subquery's result. An empty subquery result constructs a one-Field row
whose value is ``NULL``. A non-empty subquery result constructs a one-Field row
whose value is the subquery result.

If you want to restrict your code to Core SQL, (*a*) don't use the ``ROW``
<data type> or <row reference>s and <Field reference>s and, when using a <row
value constructor>, (*b*) don't use ``ARRAY[]`` or ``ARRAY??(??)`` as an
``element_expression``,(*c*) don't construct a row with more than one
Field,(*d*) don't use the ``ROW`` <keyword> in front of your
``element_expression``, and (*e*) don't use a subquery to construct your row.

Row Operations
==============

A row is compatible with, and comparable to, any row with compatible Fields --
that is, rows are mutually comparable and mutually assignable only if they have
the same number of Fields and each corresponding pair of Fields are mutually
comparable and mutually assignable. Rows may not be directly compared with, or
directly assigned to, any other <data type> class, though implicit type
conversions of their Fields can occur in expressions, ``SELECT``\s,
``INSERT``\s, ``DELETE``\s and ``UPDATE``\s. Explicit row type conversions are
not possible.

*Assignment*
------------

In SQL, when a <row type> is assigned to a <row type> target, the assignment
is done one Field at a time -- that is, the source's first Field value is
assigned to the target's first Field, the source's second Field value is
assigned to the target's second Field, and so on. Assignment of a <row type>
to another <row type> is possible only if (*a*) both <row type>s have the same
number of Fields and (*b*) each corresponding pair of Fields have <data type>s
that are mutually assignable.

[Obscure Rule] Since only SQL accepts null values, if your source is ``NULL``,
then your target's value is not changed. Instead, your DBMS will set its
indicator parameter to -1, to indicate that an assignment of the null value was
attempted. If your target doesn't have an indicator parameter, the assignment
will fail: your DBMS will return the ``SQLSTATE error 22002 "data
exception-null value, no indicator parameter"``. Going the other way, there are
two ways to assign a null value to an SQL-data target. Within SQL, you can use
the <keyword> ``NULL`` in an ``INSERT`` or an ``UPDATE`` statement to indicate
that the target should be set to ``NULL``; that is, if your source is ``NULL``,
your DBMS will set your target to ``NULL``. Outside of SQL, if your source has
an indicator parameter that is set to -1, your DBMS will set your target to
``NULL`` (regardless of the value of the source). (An indicator parameter with
a value less than -1 will cause an error: your DBMS will return the ``SQLSTATE
error 22010 "data exception-invalid indicator parameter value"``.) We'll talk
more about indicator parameters in our chapters on SQL binding styles.

*Comparison*
------------

SQL provides the usual scalar comparison operators -- = and <> and < and <= and
> and >= -- to perform operations on rows. All of them will be familiar; there
are equivalent operators in other computer languages. Two rows are comparable
if (*a*) both have the same number of Fields and (*b*) each corresponding pair
of Fields have <data type>s that are mutually comparable. Comparison is between
pairs of Fields in corresponding ordinal positions -- that is, the first Field
of the first row is compared to the first Field of the second row, the second
Field of the first row is compared to the second Field of the second row, an so
on. If either comparand is ``NULL`` the result of the operation is ``UNKNOWN``.

The result of a <row type> comparison depends on two things: (*a*) the
comparison operator and (*b*) whether any Field is ``NULL``. The order of
comparison is:

- If the comparison operator is = or <>: First the Field pairs which don´t
  include  ``NULL``\s, then the pairs which do.

- If the comparison operator is anything other than = or <>: Field pairs from
  left to right. COmparison stops when the result is unequal or ``UNKNOWN``, or
  when there are no more Fields. The result of the row comparison is the result
  of the last Field pair comparison.

Here are the possibilities.

1. If the comparison operator is =. The row comparision is (*a*) ``TRUE`` if
   the comparision is ``TRUE`` for every pair of Fields, (*b*) ``FALSE`` if any
   non-null pair is not  equal, and (*c*) ``UNKNOWN`` if at least one Field is
   ``NULL`` and all non-null pairs are equal. For example:

   ::

      ROW (1,1,1) = ROW (1,1,1)          -- returns TRUE
      ROW (1,1,1) = ROW (1,2,1)          -- returns FALSE
      ROW (1,NULL,1) = ROW (2,2,1)       -- returns FALSE
      ROW (1,NULL,1) = ROW (1,2,1)       -- returns UNKNOWN

2. Comparison operator is <>. The row comparison is (*a*) ``TRUE`` if any
   non-null pair is not equal, (*b*) ``FALSE`` if the comparison is ``FALSE``
   for every pair of Fields, and (*c*) ``UNKNOWN`` if at least one Field is
   ``NULL`` and all non-null pairs are equal. For example:

   ::

     ROW (1,1,1) <> ROW (1,2,1)         -- returns TRUE
     ROW (1,NULL,2) <> ROW (2,2,1)      -- returns TRUE
     ROW (2,2,1) <> ROW (2,2,1)         -- returns FALSE
     ROW (1,NULL,1) <> ROW (1,2,1)      -- returns UNKNOWN

3. Comparison operator is anything other than = or <>. THe row comparison is
   (*a*) ``TRUE`` if the comparison is ``TRUE`` for at least one pair of Field
   and every pair *before* the ``TRUE`` result is equal, (*b*) ``FALSE`` uf the
   comparison is ``FALSE`` for at least one pair of Fields and every pair
   *before* the ``FALSE`` result is equal,  and (*c*) ``UNKNOWN`` if the
   comparison is ``UNKNWON`` for at least one pair of Fields and every pair
   *before* the ``UNKNOWN`` result is equal. Comparison stops as soon as any of
   these results (``TRUE``, ``FALSE``, or ``UNKNOWN``) is established. For
   example:

   ::

     ROW (1,1,1) < ROW (1,2,1)           -- returns TRUE
     ROW (1,NULL,1) < ROW (2,NULL,0)     -- returns TRUE
     ROW (1,1,1) < ROW (1,1,1)           -- returns FALSE
     ROW (3,NULL,1) < ROW (2,NULL,0)     -- returns FALSE
     ROW (2,NULL,1) < ROW (1,2,0)        -- returns UNKNOWN
     ROW (NULL,1,1) < ROW (2,1,0)        -- returns UNKNOWN

SQL also provides three quantifiers -- ``ALL``, ``SOME``, ``ANY`` -- which you
can use along with a comparison operator to compare a row value with the
collection of values returned by a <table subquery>. Place the quantifier after
the comparison operator, immediately before the <table subquery>. For example:

::

   SELECT row_column
   FROM   Table_1
   WHERE  row_column < ALL (
      SELECT row_column
      FROM   Table_2);

``ALL`` returns ``TRUE`` either (*a*) if the collection is an empty set (i.e.:
if it contains zero rows) or (*b*) if the comparison operator returns ``TRUE``
for every value in the collection. ``ALL`` returns ``FALSE`` if the comparison
operator returns ``FALSE`` for at least one value in the collection.

``SOME`` and ``ANY`` are synonyms. They return ``TRUE`` if the comparison
operator returns TRUE for at least one value in the collection. They return
``FALSE`` either (*a*) if the collection is an empty set or (*b*) if the
comparison operator returns ``FALSE`` for every value in the collection. The
search condition ``= ANY (collection)`` is equivalent to "IN (collection)``.

*Other Operations*
------------------

With SQL, you have several other operations that you can perform on <row
type>s.

Scalar functions
................

All of SQL's scalar functions return a row with one Field: its value is the
result of the function. We discuss the scalar functions in our other <data
type> chapters and won't repeat the information here.

Set functions
.............

SQL provides three set functions that operate on a <row type>: ``COUNT`` and
``GROUPING``. Since none of these operate exclusively with row arguments, we
won't discuss them here; look for them in our chapter on set functions.

Predicates
..........

In addition to the comparison operators, SQL provides twelve other predicates
that operate on rows: the <between predicate>, the <in predicate>, the <like
predicate>, the <null predicate>, the <exists predicate>, the <unique
predicate>, the <match predicate>, the <overlaps predicate>, the <similar
predicate>, the <quantified predicate>, the <distinct predicate> and the <type
predicate>. Each will return a boolean value: either ``TRUE``, ``FALSE`` or
``UNKNOWN``. Look for the <like predicate> and the <similar predicate> in our
chapter on character strings, the <overlaps predicate> in our chapter on
temporal values, the <type predicate> in our chapter on UDTs and the rest in
our chapters on search conditions.

Comprehensive Example
=====================

Now that we've described SQL's <row type>, let's look at some example SQL
statements that put it to use.

Here is an SQL statement that creates a Table with three Columns, the third of
which is a <row type>:

::

   CREATE TABLE Lineage (
     name CHAR(5),
     status CHAR(10),
     last_litter ROW(dog CHAR(5),mated DATE,pups SMALLINT));

In this Table definition, ``ROW(...)`` indicates that the ``last_litter``
Column is a <row type> with three Fields.

This SQL statement adds a row to the ``Lineage`` Table:

::

   INSERT INTO TABLE Lineage (
     name,
     status,
     last_litter)
   VALUES (
     'Spot',                               -- name
     'Field Dog',                          -- status
     ROW('Fido',DATE '1994-07-15',6));     -- last_litter

In this INSERT statement, ``ROW('Fido',DATE '1994-07-15',6)`` is a <row value
constructor> that specifies the values for the three Fields of the
``last_litter`` Column <row type>.

A Field of a <row type> can be updated using a <Field reference>. For example,
this SQL statement would change the rows in the ``Lineage`` Table by updating the
third Field of every ``last_litter`` value:

::

   UPDATE Lineage SET
     last_litter.pups = 5;

This example uses a <numeric literal> to change the value of ``last_litter``'s
third Field. The result is that the third Field contains the number '5' and the
other Fields are unchanged. We could have achieved the same result by assigning
a <row value constructor> to the ``last_litter`` Column as a whole, as in this
example:

::

   UPDATE Lineage SET
     last_litter = ROW('Fido',DATE '1994-07-15',5);

Here is an example of a query on the ``Lineage`` Table:

::

   SELECT name, status, last_litter
   FROM   Lineage
   WHERE  last_litter.dog = 'Fido';

In this ``SELECT`` statement, the ``last_litter`` Column is referred to as a
whole in the <select list>, but only the value of its first Field is referred
to in the ``WHERE`` clause. The result is the entire row we inserted earlier.
