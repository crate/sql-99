Chapter 5 -- Binary strings
===========================

In SQL, a binary string, (or ``BLOB``), is any arbitrary sequence of zero or
more octets that isn't associated with either a Character set or a Collation. A
``BLOB`` value may be a <literal>, the value of a parameter or a host language
variable or the result of any expression or argument (including a possibly
qualified <Column name>) that evaluates to a binary string. ``BLOB``\s represent
an unknown lump of binary data: the typical use of a ``BLOB`` <data type> is to
store an image.

Octets in a ``BLOB`` are numbered from left to right beginning with 1 (the most
significant octet). ``BLOB``\s are stored in the binary string <data type>:
``BLOB``.

<BLOB literal>s
===============

A <BLOB literal> is the letter "X" (upper case mandatory) followed by a string
of zero or more *hexits* inside a pair of single quote marks. A hexit is either
(*a*) any of the digits 0 through 9 or (*b*) any of the letters A through F
(upper case or lower case allowed) and is four bits long -- 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F are interpreted as 0000, 0001, 0010, 0011,
0100, 0101, 0110, 0111, 1000, 1001, 1010, 1011, 1100, 1101, 1110 and 1111,
respectively.) Its <data type> is variable length ``BLOB``. The <literal>'s
length is four times the number of hexits inside the quote marks; the
delimiting single quotes are not part of the <literal>, therefore they are not
included in the calculation of the <BLOB literal>'s size. Here are some
examples of <BLOB literal>s:

::

   X'49FE'
   X'a31d'

[Obscure Rule] A long <BLOB literal> may be broken up into two or more smaller
<BLOB literal>s, split by a <separator> that must include a newline character.
When such a <literal> is encountered, your DBMS will ignore the <separator>
and treat the multiple strings as a single <literal>. For example, these two
<BLOB literal>s are equivalent:

::

       X'49FE'
       'A31D'
       X'49FEA31D'

(In the first example, there is a carriage return newline <separator> between
``FE'`` and ``'A3``.)

BLOB <data type>s
=================

A ``BLOB`` <data type> is defined by a descriptor that contains two pieces of
information:

1. The <data type>'s name: ``BINARY LARGE OBJECT``.

2. The <data type>'s maximum length in octets.

BLOB
----

The required syntax for a ``BINARY LARGE OBJECT`` <data type> specification is
as follows.


::

    BINARY LARGE OBJECT <data type> ::=
    { BINARY LARGE OBJECT | BLOB } [ (length) ]

``BINARY LARGE OBJECT`` may be abbreviated as ``BLOB`` and is a variable length
binary string, up to "length" octets long; it defines a set of binary string
values that are any correctly sized string of octets that are not associated
with a Character set or a Collation. For example, these <BLOB literal>s:

::

   X'49FE'
   X'178FA3A8'

are both valid values for this <data type> specification:

::

   BLOB(8)

The optional length, if specified, is an unsigned positive integer, possibly
followed by a letter code (either "K", "M" or "G"), that defines the maximum
octet length of acceptable values in the ``BLOB`` field.


- If the length *n* is not followed by a letter code, the ``BLOB`` may hold
  up to *n* ocets.

- The length may include the letter code "K" (kilobyte), "M" (megabyte), or "G"
  (gigabyte). If the length is defined as *nK*, the ``BLOB`` may hold up to
  *n\*1,024* octets. If the length is defined as *nM*, the ``BLOB`` may hold
  up to *integer\*1,048,576* octets. If the length is defined as *nG*, the
  ``BLOB`` may hold up to *n\*1,073,741,824* octets.

For example, this specification defines a set of binary string values that may
range from zero to 20 ocets:

::

   BLOB(20)

(Zero length binary strings can be stored in a ``BLOB`` field.)

This <data type> specification defines a set of binary string values that may
range from zero to 2048 octets:

::

   BLOB(2K)

This <data type> specification defines a set of binary string values that may
range from zero to 2,097,152 octets:

::

   BLOB(2M)

And this <data type> specification defines a set of binary string values that
may range from zero to 2,147,483,648 octets:

::

   BLOB(2G)

[NON-PORTABLE] The default length and the maximum length for ``BLOB`` are
non-standard because the SQL Standard requires implementors to define
``BLOB``'s default and maximum lengths. [OCELOT Implementation] The OCELOT DBMS
that comes with this book allows the length of ``BLOB`` to range from 1 to 32
and sets the default length of a ``BLOB`` <data type> to 1K. For example, these
two <data type> specifications are equivalent: both define a set of binary
string values that may range from zero to 1024 octets:

::

   BLOB
   BLOB(1K)

Now that we've described SQL's ``BLOB`` <data type>, let's look at some example
SQL statements that put it to use.

These SQL statements make a Table with one binary string Column, insert a row,
then search for any binary string equal to the bit string 01000100.

::

    CREATE TABLE Binary_Examples (
          occurrence_binary BLOB(2K));

    INSERT INTO Binary_Examples (
          occurrence_binary)
          VALUES (X'4D');

    SELECT occurrence_binary,
    FROM   Binary_Examples
    WHERE  occurrence_binary = X'44';

BLOB Operations
===============

A ``BLOB`` is compatible with, and comparable to, all other ``BLOB``\s -- that
is, all ``BLOB``\s are mutually assignable and mutually comparable. ``BLOB``\s
may not be directly compared with, or directly assigned to, any other <data
type> class, though implicit type conversions can sometimes occur in
expressions, ``SELECT``\s, ``INSERT``\s, ``DELETE``\s and ``UPDATE``\s.
Explicit ``BLOB`` conversions can be forced with the ``CAST`` operator.

*CAST*
------

In SQL, ``CAST`` is a scalar operator that converts a given scalar value to a
given scalar <data type>. The required syntax for the ``CAST`` operator is:

::

    CAST (<cast operand> AS <cast target>)
       <cast operand> ::= scalar_expression
       <cast target> ::= <Domain name> | <data type>

The ``CAST`` operator converts values of a source <data type> into values of a
target <data type>, where each <data type> is an SQL pre-defined <data type>
(data conversions between UDTs are done with a user-defined cast). The source
<data type> (or <cast operand>) can be any expression that evaluates to a
single value. The target <data type> (or <cast target>) is either an SQL
predefined <data type> specification or the name of a Domain whose defined
<data type> is your target <data type>. If you use ``CAST`` ``(... AS <Domain
name>)``, your current <AuthorizationID> must have the ``USAGE`` Privilege on
that Domain.

It isn't, of course, possible to convert the values of every <data type> into
the values of every other <data type>. For ``BLOB``\s, the rules are:

- ``CAST`` (``NULL AS`` <data type>) and ``CAST``
  (``blob_source_is_a_null_value AS`` <data type>) both result in ``NULL``.

- You can ``CAST`` a ``BLOB`` source to a BLOB target. You can also ``CAST`` a
  ``BLOB`` source to a UDT target or a <reference type> target if a
  user-defined cast exists for this purpose and your current <AuthorizationID>
  has the ``EXECUTE`` Privilege on that user-defined cast.

When you ``CAST`` a ``BLOB`` to a ``BLOB`` target, if the octet length of the
source value is *less than* or *equals* the maximum octet length of the target,
the result of the ``CAST`` is the source ``BLOB`` value. If the octet length of
the source value is *greater than* the maximum octet length of the target, the
result of the ``CAST`` is as much of the source ``BLOB`` value as will fit into
the target -- in this case, and your DBMS will return the ``SQLSTATE warning
01004 "warning-string data, right truncation"``.

When you ``CAST`` a ``BLOB`` to a UDT or a <reference type> target, your DBMS
invokes the user defined cast routine, with the source value as the routine's
argument. The ``CAST`` result is the value returned by the user defined cast.

If you want to restrict your code to Core SQL, (*a*) don't use <Domain name> as
a ``CAST`` target: ``CAST`` only to a <data type> and (*b*) don't use ``CAST``
to convert any ``BLOB`` value to another <data type>.

*Assignment*
------------

In SQL, when a ``BLOB`` is assigned to a BLOB target, the assignment is done
one octet at a time, from left to right -- that is, the source value's most
significant octet is assigned to the target's most significant octet, then the
source's next octet is assigned to the target's next octet, and so on.

When a ``BLOB`` is taken from SQL-data to be assigned to a BLOB target, the
size of the target is first set either to the size of the source or to its own
maximum length, whichever is less. If the source is longer than the target, the
source is truncated to fit the target. In this case, your DBMS will return the
``SQLSTATE warning 01004 "warning-string data, right truncation"``.

Here are some examples of the result you´ll get when you move a ``BLOB`` from
your database to a host language program (assume your host language variable
has a variable size of 2 ocets).

::

  source X'5550' yields a target value of 5550
  source X'55' yields a target value of 55
  source X'555500' yields a target value of 5555 and SQLSTATE 01004
  source X'555555' yields a target value of 5555 and SQLSTATE 01004

[Obscure Rule] Since only SQL accepts null values, if your source is ``NULL``,
then your target's value is not changed. Instead, your DBMS will set its
indicator parameter to -1, to indicate that an assignment of the null value was
attempted. If your target doesn't have an indicator parameter, the assignment
will fail: your DBMS will return the ``SQLSTATE error 22002 "data
exception-null value, no indicator parameter"``. If your source is a non-null
value that fits into your target, your DBMS will set the target's indicator
parameter (if any) to zero. If your source is longer than your target, your
DBMS will set your target's indicator parameter to the length of the source;
that is, if your source is 12 octets long and your target can accept only 10
octets, your DBMS will set the target's indicator parameter to 12, to indicate
that 2 octets were lost on assignment. If the source's length is too big to be
assigned to the indicator, the assignment will fail: your DBMS will return the
``SQLSTATE error 22022 "data exception-indicator overflow"``. We'll talk more
about indicator parameters in our chapters on SQL binding styles.

When a binary string is assigned to a SQL-data ``BLOB`` target, the size of the
target is first set either to the size of the source or to its own maximum
length, whichever is less. If the source is larger than the target, but the
extra octets are all 0-octets, the source's significant octet value is assigned
to the target. If the source is larger than the target and the extra octets are
not all 0-octets, the assignment will fail: your DBMS will return the
``SQLSTATE error 22001 "data exception-string data, right truncation"``.

Here are some examples of the result you´ll get when you assign a binary string
to your SQL database (assume your target is defined as ``BLOB (2)``):

::

  source X'5550' yields a target value of 5550
  source X'55' yields a target value of 55
  source X'555500' yields a target of 5555
  source X'555555' yields no change to target; assinment fails
  with SQLSTATE 22001


[Obscure Rule] There are two ways to assign a null value to an SQL-data target.
Within SQL, you can use the <keyword> ``NULL`` in an ``INSERT`` or an
``UPDATE`` statement to indicate that the target should be set to ``NULL``;
that is, if your source is ``NULL``, your DBMS will set your target to
``NULL``. Outside of SQL, if your source has an indicator parameter that is set
to -1, your DBMS will set your target to ``NULL`` (regardless of the value of
the source). An indicator parameter with a value less than -1 will cause an
error: your DBMS will return the ``SQLSTATE error 22010 "data exception-invalid
indicator parameter value"``.

Comparison
==========

SQL provides only two scalar comparison operators = and <>, to perform
operations on ``BLOB``\s. These will be familiar; there are equivalent operators
in other computer languages. If any of the comparands are ``NULL``, the result
of the operation is ``UNKNOWN``. For example:

::

   X'A3D0' = X'A3D0'

returns ``TRUE``.

::

   X'A3D0' <> {result is NULL}

returns ``UNKNOWN``.

When a ``BLOB`` is compared to another ``BLOB``, the comparison is done one
octet at a time, from left to right -- that is, the first comparand's most
significant octet is compared to the second comparand's most significant octet,
then the next two octets are compared, and so on. Two ``BLOB``\s,
``blob_argument_1`` and ``blob_argument_2``, are equal if (*a*) they have the
same length and (*b*) each octet within ``blob_argument_1`` compares as equal
to the corresponding octet in ``blob_argument_2``.

If you want to restrict your code to Core SQL, don't use ``BLOB``\s in
comparisons.

*Other Operations*
------------------

With SQL, you have several other operations that you can perform on ``BLOB``\s.

Concatenation
.............

The required syntax for a ``BLOB`` concatenation is as follows.

::

    BLOB concatenation ::=
    BLOB operand_1 || BLOB operand_2

The concatenation operator operates on two operands, both of which must
evaluate to a ``BLOB``. It joins the binary strings together in the order given
and returns a ``BLOB`` with a length equal to the sum of the lengths of its
operands. If either of the operands is ``NULL``, the result of the operation is
also ``NULL``. Here are two examples of ``BLOB`` concatenations:

::

   X'0000' || X'0011'     -- returns 00000011
   blob_column || X'0011' -- returns blob_column's value followed by 0011

[Obscure Rule] If the sum of the lengths of a ``BLOB`` concatenation's operands
is not greater than the maximum allowed length for a ``BLOB``, the
concatenation result is a ``BLOB`` with a length equal to the sum of the
lengths of the operands. If the sum of the operands' lengths is greater than
the maximum allowed, but the extra octets are all 0-octets, the concatenation
result is a BLOB with a length equal to the maximum allowed length. If the sum
of the operands' lengths is greater than the maximum allowed and the extra
octets are not all 0-octets, the concatenation will fail: your DBMS will return
the ``SQLSTATE error 22001 "data exception-string data, right truncation"``.

If you want to restrict your code to Core SQL, don't use the concatenation
operator with ``BLOB``\s.

Scalar Operations
.................

SQL provides five scalar functions that return a ``BLOB``: the <case
expression>, the <cast specification>, the <BLOB substring function>, the <BLOB
overlay function> and the <BLOB trim function>. It also provides four scalar
functions that operate on ``BLOBs``, returning a number: the <BLOB position
expression>, the <bit length expression>, the <char length expression> and the
<octet length expression>. All but the first two are described below. We'll
discuss the rest in other chapters; for now, just remember tat ``CASE`` can
evaluate to a binary string and can therefore be used anywhere in an SQL
statement that a binary string could be used.

*<BLOB substring function>*
...........................

The required syntax for a <BLOB substring function> is as follows.

::

    <BLOB substring function> ::=
    SUBSTRING (blob_argument
       FROM start_argument [ FOR length_argument ])

``SUBSTRING`` operates on three arguments: the first must evaluate to a
``BLOB``, the other two must evaluate to exact numeric integers. It extracts a
substring from ``blob_argument`` and returns a ``BLOB`` with a maximum length
that equals the maximum length of the ``BLOB`` argument. If any of the
arguments are ``NULL``, ``SUBSTRING`` returns ``NULL``.

The ``start_argument`` is a number that marks the first octet you want to
extract from ``blob_argument``. If ``SUBSTRING`` includes the (optional)
``FOR`` clause, ``length_argument`` is the total number of octets you want to
extract. If you omit the ``FOR`` clause, ``SUBSTRING`` will begin at
``start_argument`` and extract all the rest of the octets from
``blob_argument``. Here are some examples of ``SUBSTRING``:

::

   SUBSTRING(X'1049FE2996D54AB7' FROM 5)        -- returns 96D54AB7
   SUBSTRING(X'1049FE2996D54AB7' FROM 5 FOR 3)  -- returns 96D54A
   SUBSTRING(blob_column FROM 1 FOR 4)          -- returns the first four
                                                   octets of the value in
                                                   BLOB_COLUMN

If ``length_argument`` is negative, your DBMS will return ``SQLSTATE error
22011 "data exception-substring error"``. If ``start_argument`` is greater than
the length of ``blob_argument``, or if ``(start_argument + length_argument)``
is less than one. ``SUBSTRING`` returns a zero-length binary string. If
``start_argument`` is negative, of if ``blob_argument``, that´s okay -- the
DBMS just ignores any ocets before the start of ``blob_argument`` or after the
end of ``blob_argument``.


[Obscure Rule] ``SUBSTRING`` can also operate on a bit string and a character
string. We've ignored these options for now -- look for them in our chapters on
bit strings and character strings.

If you want to restrict your code to Core SQL, don't use ``SUBSTRING`` with
``BLOB``\s.

*<BLOB overlay function>*
.........................

The required syntax for a <BLOB overlay function> is:

::

  <BLOB overlay function> ::=
  OVERLAY (blob_argument_1 PLACING blob_argument_2
    FROM start_argument [ FOR length_argument ])

``OVERLAY`` operates on four arguments: the first two must evaluate to
``BLOB``\s, the other two must evaluate to exact numeric integers. It extracts
a substring from ``blob_argument_1``, replacing it with ``blob_argument_2``,
and returns the resulting ``BLOB``. If any of the arguments are ``NULL``,
``OVERLAY`` returns ``NULL``.

The ``start_argument`` is a number that marks the first octet you want to
replace in ``blob_argument_1``. If ``OVERLAY`` includes the (optional) ``FOR``
clause, ``length_argument`` is the total number of octets you want to replace.
Thus, ``start_argument`` and ``length_argument`` identify the portion of
``blob_argument_1`` that you want to replace, while ``blob_argument_2`` is what
you want to replace with. If you omit the ``FOR`` clause, then
``length_argument`` defaults to the length of ``blob_argument_2``. Here are
some examples of ``OVERLAY``:

::

   OVERLAY(X'1049FE2996D54AB7' PLACING X'1010' FROM 5)
    -- returns 1049FE2910104AB7
   OVERLAY(X'1049FE2996D54AB7' PLACING X'1010' FROM 5 FOR 1)
    -- returns 1049FE291010D54AB7

[Obscure Rule] ``OVERLAY`` can also operate on a character string. We've
ignored this option for now -- look for it in our chapter on character strings.

*<BLOB trim function>*
......................

The required syntax for a <BLOB trim function> is as follows.

::

    <BLOB trim function> ::=
    TRIM ( [ [ { LEADING | TRAILING | BOTH } ]
          [ blob_argument_1 ] FROM ]
          blob_argument_2)

``TRIM`` operates on two arguments, both of which must evaluate to ``BLOB``\s.
It strips all leading, all trailing or all leading and all trailing trim octets
from ``blob_argument_2`` and returns the resulting ``BLOB``. If any of the
arguments are ``NULL``, ``TRIM`` returns ``NULL``.

The trim specification is either ``LEADING``, i.e., trim all leading trim
octets, ``TRAILING``, i.e., trim all trailing trim octets. If this clause is
omitted, ``TRIM``  defaults to ``BOTH``. For example, these two ``TRIM``
functions are equivalent; they both strip away leading and all trailing
zero-ocets:

::

   TRIM(X'00' FROM blob_column)
   TRIM(BOTH X'00' FROM blob_column)

``blob_argument_1`` defines the trim octet: the octet that should be stripped
away by the ``TRIM`` function. If ``blob_argument_1`` is omitted, ``TRIM``
strips zero-octets away. For example, these two ``TRIM`` functions are
equivalent: they both strip away all trailing zero-octets:

::

   TRIM(TRAILING FROM blob_column)
   TRIM(TRAILING X'00' FROM blob_column)

These two ``TRIM`` functions are equivalent: they both strip away all leading
zero-octets:

::

  TRIM(LEADING FROM blob_column)
  TRIM(LEADING X'00' FROM blob_column)

These two ``TRIM`` functions are equivalent: they both strip away all leading
and all trailing zero-octets:

::

   TRIM(blob_column)
   TRIM(BOTH X'00' FROM blob_column)

If the length of ``blob_argument_1`` is not one octet, ``TRIM`` will fail: your
DBMS will return the ``SQLSTATE error 22027 "data exception-trim error"``.

[Obscure Rule] ``TRIM`` can also operate on a character string. We've ignored
this option for now -- look for it in our chapter on character strings.

*<BLOB position expression>*
............................

The required syntax for a <``BLOB`` position expression> is as follows.

::

    <BLOB position expression> ::=
    POSITION (blob_argument_1 IN blob_argument_2)

``POSITION`` operates on two arguments, both of which must evaluate to a
``BLOB``. It determines the first octet position (if any) at which
``blob_argument_1`` is found in ``blob_argument_2`` and returns this as an
exact numeric integer. If either of the arguments are ``NULL``, ``POSITION``
returns ``NULL``. If ``blob_argument_1`` is a zero-length binary string,
``POSITION`` returns one. If ``blob_argument_1`` is not found in
``blob_argument_2``, ``POSITION`` returns zero.  Here is an example:

::

   POSITION(X'3D' IN X'AF923DA7')
   -- returns 5

[NON-PORTABLE] The precision of ``POSITION``'s result is non-standard because
the SQL Standard requires implementors to define the result's precision.
[OCELOT Implementation] The OCELOT DBMS that comes with this book gives the
result of ``POSITION`` an ``INTEGER`` <data type>.

[Obscure Rule] ``POSITION`` can also operate on a bit string and a character
string. We've ignored these options for now -- look for them in our chapters on
bit strings and character strings.

*<bit length expression>*
.........................

The required syntax for a <bit length expression> is as follows.

::

    <bit length expression> ::=
    BIT_LENGTH (blob_argument)

``BIT_LENGTH`` operates on an argument that evaluates to a ``BLOB``. It
determines the length of the argument, in bits, and returns this as an exact
numeric integer, e.g., ``BIT_LENGTH(X'4AD9')`` returns 16. If the argument is
``NULL``, ``BIT_LENGTH`` returns ``NULL``.

[NON-PORTABLE] The precision of ``BIT_LENGTH``'s result is non-standard because
the SQL Standard requires implementors to define the result's precision.
[OCELOT Implementation] The OCELOT DBMS that comes with this book gives the
result of ``BIT_LENGTH`` an ``INTEGER`` <data type>.

[Obscure Rule] ``BIT_LENGTH`` can also operate on a bit string and a character
string. We've ignored these options for now -- look for them in our chapters
on bit strings and character strings.

*<char length expression>*
..........................

The required syntax for a <char length expression> is as follows.

::

    <char length expression> ::=
    {CHAR_LENGTH | CHARACTER_LENGTH} (blob_argument)

``CHAR_LENGTH`` (or ``CHARACTER_LENGTH``) operates on an argument that
evaluates to a ``BLOB``. It determines the length of the argument, in octets,
and returns this as an exact numeric integer, e.g., ``CHAR_LENGTH(X'4AD9')``
returns 2. (The octet length of a string is the bit length divided by 8,
rounded up.) If the argument is ``NULL``, ``CHAR_LENGTH`` returns ``NULL``.

[NON-PORTABLE] The precision of ``CHAR_LENGTH``'s result is non-standard
because the SQL Standard requires implementors to define the result's
precision. [OCELOT Implementation] The OCELOT DBMS that comes with this book
gives the result of ``CHAR_LENGTH`` an ``INTEGER`` <data type>.

[Obscure Rule] ``CHAR_LENGTH`` can also operate on a bit string and a character
string. We've ignored these options for now -- look for them in our chapters on
bit strings and character strings.

*<octet length expression>*
...........................

The required syntax for a <octet length expression> is as follows.

::

    <octet length expression> ::=
    OCTET_LENGTH (blob_argument)

``OCTET_LENGTH`` operates on an argument that evaluates to a ``BLOB``. It
determines the length of the argument, in octets, and returns this as an exact
numeric integer, e.g., ``OCTET_LENGTH(X'4AD9')`` returns 2. (The octet length
of a string is the bit length divided by 8, ignoring any remainder.) If the
argument is ``NULL``, ``OCTET_LENGTH`` returns ``NULL``.

[NON-PORTABLE] The precision of ``OCTET_LENGTH``'s result is non-standard
because the SQL Standard requires implementors to define the result's
precision. [OCELOT Implementation] The OCELOT DBMS that comes with this book
gives the result of ``OCTET_LENGTH`` an ``INTEGER`` <data type>.

[Obscure Rule] ``OCTET_LENGTH`` can also operate on a bit string and a
character string. We've ignored these options for now -- look for them in our
chapters on bit strings and character strings.

Set functions
-------------

SQL provides three set functions that operate on binary strings: ``COUNT`` and
``GROUPING``. Since none of these operate exclusively with binary string
arguments, we won't discuss them here; look for them in our chapter on set
functions.

Predicates
----------

In addition to the = and <> comparison operators, SQL provides four other
predicates that operate on ``BLOB``\s: the <like predicate>, the <null
predicate>, the <exists predicate> and the <quantified predicate>. Each will
return a boolean value: either ``TRUE``, ``FALSE`` or ``UNKNOWN``. Only the
first predicate operates strictly on string values; we'll discuss it here. Look
for the rest in our chapter on search conditions.

*<like predicate>*
..................

The required syntax for a <like predicate> is as follows.

::

    <like predicate> ::=
    blob_argument [ NOT ] LIKE pattern [ ESCAPE escape_octet ]

``LIKE`` is a predicate that operates on three operands that evaluate to
``BLOB``\s: it searches for values that contain a given pattern. ``NOT LIKE`` is
the converse and lets you search for values that don't contain a given pattern.
The ``blob_argument`` is the binary string you're searching within, the
``pattern`` is the pattern you're searching for and the optional
``escape_octet`` is an octet that tells your DBMS to treat a metacharacter in
the pattern as itself (rather than as a metacharacter). If ``blob_argument``
contains the pattern, ``LIKE`` returns ``TRUE`` and ``NOT LIKE`` returns
``FALSE``. If ``blob_argument`` does not contain the pattern, ``LIKE`` returns
``FALSE`` and ``NOT LIKE`` returns ``TRUE``. If any of the operands are
``NULL``, ``LIKE`` and ``NOT LIKE`` return ``UNKNOWN``.

The pattern you specify in ``pattern`` may contain any combination of regular
octets and metaoctets. Any single octet in ``pattern`` that is not a metaoctet
or the ``escape_octet`` represents itself in the pattern. For example, this
predicate:

::

   blob_column LIKE X'A3'

is ``TRUE`` for the octet represented by 'A3'.

Special significance is attached to metaoctets in a pattern. The metaoctets are
equivalent to the _ and % characters. That is, an underscore metaocet has the
same bit pattern as an underscore character in the ``SQL_TEXT`` Character set
and a percent octet has the same bit pattern as a percent sign in the
``SQL_TEXT`` Character set.( In practice, the bit pattern for _ will be
``X'5F'`` and the bit pattern for % will be ``X'25'``. Thtese values correspond
to the encodings used in all the ISO character sets.)

If the predicate doesn't include an ``ESCAPE`` clause, they are interpreted as
follows:

- An underline octet means "any single octet". For example, this predicate:

::

   blob_column LIKE X' AA5FCC'

is ``TRUE`` for ``X'AAOOCC'``, ``X'AAAACC'``, ``X'AABBCC'``, ``X'AA66CC'`` and
so on.

- A percent sign means "any string of zero or more octets". For example, this
  predicate:

::

   blob_column LIKE X'AA25CC'

is ``TRUE`` for ``X'AACC'``, ``X'AAOOCC'``, ``X'AABBCC'``, ``X'AA66CC'``,
``X'AA6666CC'`` and so on.

If you want to search for an octet that would normally be interpreted as a
metaoctet, you must use the optional ``ESCAPE`` clause. To do so:

- Pick an octet that you won't need in the pattern and designate it as your
  escape octet.

- In the pattern, use your escape octet followed immediately by the metaoctet,
  to designate the metaoctet as an octet you want to search for. For example:

::

   ... LIKE X'BB25'

(without an ``ESCAPE`` clause) means "like the ocet BB followed by anything at
all", while:

::

   ... LIKE X'BBFF25' ESCAPE X'FF'

means "like the ocet BB followed by the octet 25" (because 25 is preceded by
the escape ocet has no special significance in this pattern). Your escape ocet
can also be followed by itself in the pattern, if you want to search for the
escape character. For example:

::

   ... LIKE X'BBFFFF' ESCAPE X'FF'

means "like the ocet BB followed by the ocet FF" (since FF is preceded by the
escape ocet it has no special significance in this pattern).

The ``escape_octet`` must be exactly one octet long. If it isn't, ``[NOT]
LIKE`` will fail: your DBMS will return the ``SQLSTATE error 2200D "data
exception-invalid escape octet"``. If ``escape_octet`` is underscore metaocet
or percent metaocet and that metaoctet is used once only in your pattern, or if
``escape_octet`` is used without being followed by a metaoctet (or by itself)
in your pattern, [NOT] LIKE will fail: your DBMS will return the ``SQLSTATE
error 22025 "data exception-invalid escape sequence"``. For example, these two
predicates will both result in ``SQLSTATE 22025``:

::

   LIKE X'B%B' ESCAPE X'25'
   LIKE X'B?B' ESCAPE X'FF'

For the purposes of ``[NOT] LIKE``, a substring of ``blob_argument`` is a
sequence of zero or more contiguous octets, where each octet belongs to exactly
one such substring. A substring specifier of ``pattern`` is either (*a*) the
underscore metaocet, an arbitrary octet specifier, (*b*) th percent metaocet,
an arbitrary string specifier, (*c*) ``escape_octet`` followed by the
underscore metaocet or the percent metaocet or the escape octet or (*d*) any
other single octet. If ``blob_argument`` and ``pattern`` both have a length of
zero, ``LIKE`` returns ``TRUE``. ``LIKE`` also returns ``TRUE`` if ``pattern``
is found in ``blob_argument``. That is, ``LIKE`` returns ``TRUE`` only if the
number of substrings in ``blob_argument`` equals the number of substring
specifiers in "pattern" and all of these conditions are also met:

- If the pattern's *n*-th substring specifier is the underscore metaocet, then
  the argument's *n*-th substring must be any single octet.

- If the pattern's *n*-th substring specifier is percent metaocet, then the
  argument's *n*-th substring must be any sequence of zero or more octets.

- If the pattern's *n*-th substring specifier is any other octet, then the
  argument's *n*-th substring must have the same length and bit pattern as that
  substring specifier.

[Obscure Rule] ``[NOT] LIKE`` can also operate on character strings. We've
ignored this option for now -- look for it in our chapter on character strings.

If you want to restrict your code to Core SQL, don't use the ``[NOT] LIKE``
predicate with ``BLOB``\s.
