.. NOTE::

    You are reading a digital copy of *SQL-99 Complete, Really*, a book that
    documents the `SQL-99 standard`_.

    The book and the standard does not reflect the features of CrateDB,
    we are just publishing it as a service for the community and for reference
    purposes.

    On the one hand, CrateDB does not implement the SQL-99 standard thoroughly,
    on the other hand, it extends the standard for implementing cluster features
    and others.

    For more information specific to CrateDB, check out the `CrateDB
    Reference`_ documentation.
