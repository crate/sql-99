Appendix E -- SQL Web Sites
===========================

You will get millions of hits if you submit the keyword SQL to any Internet
search engine. You will get only 12 hits from this list. But they all have one
interesting common feature: FREE STUFF. Our list of SQL web sites includes:

* Private companies which produce SQL databases or SQL-related programs,
  and which allow downloads of real working programs.

* Both government and private bodies which produce SQL-related
  standards.

* Sites which offer timely and real SQL news.

Our selection is primarily of English-speaking sites. As URLs change, and as
new sites match our criteria, we will update a copy of this list at our own
web site: http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/OCELOTSQL/sites.htm

So probably your best way to keep up-to-date is to add our web site to your
favourite places, and click links from there.
